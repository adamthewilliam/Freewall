Freewall is a solution to the problem of many news & media websites blocking their content behind subscription paywalls. This is particulary annoying when trying to read financial news. Freewall solves this problem by making it convenient for the user to open links in a web archive website. A web archive website allows the user to view the web page content without the paywall.

Freewall does all this as a chromium extension. Simply add the extension to Google Chrome by using the following link https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/freewall/dhjghciiiiedfgidmcmablgbjndibhmf?hl=en or alternatively load these files as an unpacked extension and off you go!
